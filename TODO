Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.
   The complexity scale is exponential, with complexity 1 being the
   lowest complexity. Complexity is a function of both task 'complexity'
   and task 'scope'.

Core
====

- NDEF building library

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C4
  Owner: Ravikumar Veeramally <ravikumar.veeramally@intel.com>

  This library should provide a simple API to build NDEFs based on very high
  level input, e.g. an image or an URL.


- Writer Mode

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C4
  Dependencies: Core:NDEF building library
  Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

  In writer mode, neard allows application to write to an NFC tag.


- Card Emulation Mode

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C8
  Dependencies: Core:NDEF building library
  Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

  In card emulation mode, the NFC adapter is in passive mode, and gets
  activated by an initiator mode device. Then the initiator sends command
  that the target is supposed to interpret and respond to. Most of the
  commands are tag specific.
  For a proper card emulation mode support, the NFC adapter must enter the
  polling loop and not only initiate the RF field, but then wait for intiator
  to activate it. Once activated, the NFC socket should enter the accept
  state, and dispatch the various commands to the right plugins (one per
  protocol, a.k.a. tags).


- p2p Mode

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C8
  Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>
  Dependencies: Core:NDEF building library
  Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

  In p2p mode, an NFC adapter can either be in target or initiator mode.
  A link is established between 2 NFC adapters, and can be connection or
  connection less oriented. NDEFs are exchanged through the SNEP (NFC
  Forum draft) protocol.


- Read/Write permission check

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

  A tag can be in read only or read/write mode, and that needs to be
  exported trough the D-Bus interface.


- UID export

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

  Many NFC tags do have a UID associated to it. This is tag type dependent
  but could be exported through the D-Bus interface as well.

Reader mode
===========

- Type 4 tag support

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C4
  Owner: Olivier Guiter <olivier.guiter@linux.intel.com>


- Topaz 512 (type 1) tag support

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Olivier Guiter <olivier.guiter@linux.intel.com>
